Week 3
There should be a file called Reflection.txt in the Practical3 folder, but I made a mistake and put it somewhere else. Now I have changed it to the correct path.
Also, commit messages for Week 3 should be informative. However, I just wrote "Initialise". Now I have changed it into "add Reflection.txt".

Week 4
There should be a commented line that says what the code does: Generates pair of random numbers between 1 and 6 until two identical numbers are found. Reports how many iterations this took.However, I did not reflect the control flow ("until match found") and the range (1â€“6) explicitly. Instead, I just mentioned that the code was to imitate two dices. Now I have changed it into "This code generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, and count how many times the two numbers will show the same number (keep finding until match is found)".

Week 5
A dictionary that matches the input when the input table is changed should be displayed. However, my counts list was manually entered and failed to link it dynamically to the dictionary values so that changes to the dictionary could also affect the chart. To solve the problem, I have changed the code into "languages = list(data.keys())" and "counts = list(data.values())".
