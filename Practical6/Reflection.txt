Was it hard?
It was sooooooo hard to write everything from the bottom!!! 
Yet after I get help from othersï¼ŒI thought it was not that hard. Maybe it's because I have never been exposed to certain functions and do not know how to use it.

Were there bits you enjoyed more (or less) than others?
I enjoyed less when I try to write the infection_snippet.py myself. 
It challenges my stupid brain. I don not write out the code x = infectedIndex[0][i],y = infectedIndex[1][i], but it should be easy to think about!

What was the most important thing you learned?
The model can really illustrate a totally different picture sometimes. At first, I thought that I had written the wrong code. However, it turns out that it was out of probability.
In SIR_vaccination.py, sometimes the graph will include less than 11 lines, while sometimes it is perfect. 
I think it is because I use N instead of N-vaccinated to calculate the infection rate, which results in the unbelievable small infection rate in high herd immunity. Maybe the model can be optimized.

At the same time, I have a little question. If vaccinated number is 100%, in the context there will be no infected people at first, but it is contradictory to the assumption that one person is affected. 
I choose to set suscepitble number as 0 this situation, but I think we should not include 100% vaccinated people in the model anyway.
